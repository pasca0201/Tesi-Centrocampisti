A guide to masked arrays in NumPy 
================================== 
</span>
<span class="s1">.. </span><span class="s2">Contents::</span>

<span class="s1">See </span><span class="s3">http://www.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/MaskedArray </span><span class="s1">(dead link)</span>
<span class="s1">for updates of this document.</span>


<span class="s0">History 
------- 
</span>
<span class="s1">As a regular user of MaskedArray, I (Pierre G.F. Gerard-Marchant) became</span>
<span class="s1">increasingly frustrated with the subclassing of masked arrays (even if</span>
<span class="s1">I can only blame my inexperience). I needed to develop a class of arrays</span>
<span class="s1">that could store some additional information along with numerical values,</span>
<span class="s1">while keeping the possibility for missing data (picture storing a series</span>
<span class="s1">of dates along with measurements, what would later become the </span><span class="s3">`TimeSeries 
Scikit &lt;http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/scikits/wiki/TimeSeries&gt;`__</span>
<span class="s1">(dead link).</span>

<span class="s1">I started to implement such a class, but then quickly realized that</span>
<span class="s1">any additional information disappeared when processing these subarrays</span>
<span class="s1">(for example, adding a constant value to a subarray would erase its</span>
<span class="s1">dates). I ended up writing the equivalent of </span><span class="s4">*numpy.core.ma* </span><span class="s1">for my</span>
<span class="s1">particular class, ufuncs included. Everything went fine until I needed to</span>
<span class="s1">subclass my new class, when more problems showed up: some attributes of</span>
<span class="s1">the new subclass were lost during processing. I identified the culprit as</span>
<span class="s1">MaskedArray, which returns masked ndarrays when I expected masked</span>
<span class="s1">arrays of my class. I was preparing myself to rewrite </span><span class="s4">*numpy.core.ma*</span>
<span class="s1">when I forced myself to learn how to subclass ndarrays. As I became more</span>
<span class="s1">familiar with the </span><span class="s4">*__new__* </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s4">*__array_finalize__* </span><span class="s1">methods,</span>
<span class="s1">I started to wonder why masked arrays were objects, and not ndarrays,</span>
<span class="s1">and whether it wouldn't be more convenient for subclassing if they did</span>
<span class="s1">behave like regular ndarrays.</span>

<span class="s1">The new </span><span class="s4">*maskedarray* </span><span class="s1">is what I eventually come up with. The</span>
<span class="s1">main differences with the initial </span><span class="s4">*numpy.core.ma* </span><span class="s1">package are</span>
<span class="s1">that MaskedArray is now a subclass of </span><span class="s4">*ndarray* </span><span class="s1">and that the</span>
<span class="s4">*_data* </span><span class="s1">section can now be any subclass of </span><span class="s4">*ndarray*</span><span class="s1">. Apart from a</span>
<span class="s1">couple of issues listed below, the behavior of the new MaskedArray</span>
<span class="s1">class reproduces the old one. Initially the </span><span class="s4">*maskedarray*</span>
<span class="s1">implementation was marginally slower than </span><span class="s4">*numpy.ma* </span><span class="s1">in some areas,</span>
<span class="s1">but work is underway to speed it up; the expectation is that it can be</span>
<span class="s1">made substantially faster than the present </span><span class="s4">*numpy.ma*</span><span class="s1">.</span>


<span class="s1">Note that if the subclass has some special methods and</span>
<span class="s1">attributes, they are not propagated to the masked version:</span>
<span class="s1">this would require a modification of the </span><span class="s4">*__getattribute__*</span>
<span class="s1">method (first trying </span><span class="s4">*ndarray.__getattribute__*</span><span class="s1">, then trying</span>
<span class="s4">*self._data.__getattribute__* </span><span class="s1">if an exception is raised in the first</span>
<span class="s1">place), which really slows things down.</span>

<span class="s0">Main differences 
---------------- 
</span>
 <span class="s1">* The </span><span class="s4">*_data* </span><span class="s1">part of the masked array can be any subclass of ndarray (but not recarray, cf below).</span>
 <span class="s1">* </span><span class="s4">*fill_value* </span><span class="s1">is now a property, not a function.</span>
 <span class="s1">* in the majority of cases, the mask is forced to </span><span class="s4">*nomask* </span><span class="s1">when no value is actually masked. A notable exception is when a masked array (with no masked values) has just been unpickled.</span>
 <span class="s1">* I got rid of the </span><span class="s4">*share_mask* </span><span class="s1">flag, I never understood its purpose.</span>
 <span class="s1">* </span><span class="s4">*put*</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s4">*putmask* </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s4">*take* </span><span class="s1">now mimic the ndarray methods, to avoid unpleasant surprises. Moreover, </span><span class="s4">*put* </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s4">*putmask* </span><span class="s1">both update the mask when needed.  * if *a* is a masked array, </span><span class="s4">*bool(a)* </span><span class="s1">raises a </span><span class="s4">*ValueError*</span><span class="s1">, as it does with ndarrays.</span>
 <span class="s1">* in the same way, the comparison of two masked arrays is a masked array, not a boolean</span>
 <span class="s1">* </span><span class="s4">*filled(a)* </span><span class="s1">returns an array of the same subclass as </span><span class="s4">*a._data*</span><span class="s1">, and no test is performed on whether it is contiguous or not.</span>
 <span class="s1">* the mask is always printed, even if it's </span><span class="s4">*nomask*</span><span class="s1">, which makes things easy (for me at least) to remember that a masked array is used.</span>
 <span class="s1">* </span><span class="s4">*cumsum* </span><span class="s1">works as if the </span><span class="s4">*_data* </span><span class="s1">array was filled with 0. The mask is preserved, but not updated.</span>
 <span class="s1">* </span><span class="s4">*cumprod* </span><span class="s1">works as if the </span><span class="s4">*_data* </span><span class="s1">array was filled with 1. The mask is preserved, but not updated.</span>

<span class="s0">New features 
------------ 
</span>
<span class="s1">This list is non-exhaustive...</span>

 <span class="s1">* the </span><span class="s4">*mr_* </span><span class="s1">function mimics </span><span class="s4">*r_* </span><span class="s1">for masked arrays.</span>
 <span class="s1">* the </span><span class="s4">*anom* </span><span class="s1">method returns the anomalies (deviations from the average)</span>

<span class="s0">Using the new package with numpy.core.ma 
---------------------------------------- 
</span>
<span class="s1">I tried to make sure that the new package can understand old masked</span>
<span class="s1">arrays. Unfortunately, there's no upward compatibility.</span>

<span class="s1">For example:</span>

<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy.core.ma as old_ma</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; import maskedarray as new_ma</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = old_ma.array([1,2,3,4,5], mask=[0,0,1,0,0])</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; x</span>
<span class="s1">array(data =</span>
 <span class="s1">[     1      2 999999      4      5],</span>
      <span class="s1">mask =</span>
 <span class="s1">[False False True False False],</span>
      <span class="s1">fill_value=999999)</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; y = new_ma.array([1,2,3,4,5], mask=[0,0,1,0,0])</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; y</span>
<span class="s1">array(data = [1 2 -- 4 5],</span>
      <span class="s1">mask = [False False True False False],</span>
      <span class="s1">fill_value=999999)</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; x==y</span>
<span class="s1">array(data =</span>
 <span class="s1">[True True True True True],</span>
      <span class="s1">mask =</span>
 <span class="s1">[False False True False False],</span>
      <span class="s1">fill_value=?)</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; old_ma.getmask(x) == new_ma.getmask(x)</span>
<span class="s1">array([True, True, True, True, True])</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; old_ma.getmask(y) == new_ma.getmask(y)</span>
<span class="s1">array([True, True, False, True, True])</span>
<span class="s1">&gt;&gt;&gt; old_ma.getmask(y)</span>
<span class="s1">False</span>


<span class="s0">Using maskedarray with matplotlib 
--------------------------------- 
</span>
<span class="s1">Starting with matplotlib 0.91.2, the masked array importing will work with</span>
<span class="s1">the maskedarray branch) as well as with earlier versions.</span>

<span class="s1">By default matplotlib still uses numpy.ma, but there is an rcParams setting</span>
<span class="s1">that you can use to select maskedarray instead.  In the matplotlibrc file</span>
<span class="s1">you will find:: 
 
  </span><span class="s5">#maskedarray : False       # True to use external maskedarray module 
                             # instead of numpy.ma; this is a temporary # 
                             setting for testing maskedarray. 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">Uncomment and set to True to select maskedarray everywhere.</span>
<span class="s1">Alternatively, you can test a script with maskedarray by using a</span>
<span class="s1">command-line option, e.g.:: 
 
  </span><span class="s5">python simple_plot.py --maskedarray 
 
 
</span><span class="s0">Masked records 
-------------- 
</span>
<span class="s1">Like </span><span class="s4">*numpy.ma.core*</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s4">*ndarray*</span><span class="s1">-based implementation</span>
<span class="s1">of MaskedArray is limited when working with records: you can</span>
<span class="s1">mask any record of the array, but not a field in a record. If you</span>
<span class="s1">need this feature, you may want to give the </span><span class="s4">*mrecords* </span><span class="s1">package</span>
<span class="s1">a try (available in the </span><span class="s4">*maskedarray* </span><span class="s1">directory in the scipy</span>
<span class="s1">sandbox). This module defines a new class, </span><span class="s4">*MaskedRecord*</span><span class="s1">. An</span>
<span class="s1">instance of this class accepts a </span><span class="s4">*recarray* </span><span class="s1">as data, and uses two</span>
<span class="s1">masks: the </span><span class="s4">*fieldmask* </span><span class="s1">has as many entries as records in the array,</span>
<span class="s1">each entry with the same fields as a record, but of boolean types:</span>
<span class="s1">they indicate whether the field is masked or not; a record entry</span>
<span class="s1">is flagged as masked in the </span><span class="s4">*mask* </span><span class="s1">array if all the fields are</span>
<span class="s1">masked. A few examples in the file should give you an idea of what</span>
<span class="s1">can be done. Note that </span><span class="s4">*mrecords* </span><span class="s1">is still experimental...</span>

<span class="s0">Optimizing maskedarray 
---------------------- 
</span>
<span class="s0">Should masked arrays be filled before processing or not? 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
</span>
<span class="s1">In the current implementation, most operations on masked arrays involve</span>
<span class="s1">the following steps:</span>

 <span class="s1">* the input arrays are filled</span>
 <span class="s1">* the operation is performed on the filled arrays</span>
 <span class="s1">* the mask is set for the results, from the combination of the input masks and the mask corresponding to the domain of the operation.</span>

<span class="s1">For example, consider the division of two masked arrays:: 
 
  </span><span class="s5">import numpy 
  import maskedarray as ma 
  x = ma.array([1,2,3,4],mask=[1,0,0,0], dtype=numpy.float64) 
  y = ma.array([-1,0,1,2], mask=[0,0,0,1], dtype=numpy.float64) 
 
</span><span class="s1">The division of x by y is then computed as:: 
 
  </span><span class="s5">d1 = x.filled(0) # d1 = array([0., 2., 3., 4.]) 
  d2 = y.filled(1) # array([-1.,  0.,  1.,  1.]) 
  m = ma.mask_or(ma.getmask(x), ma.getmask(y)) # m = 
  array([True,False,False,True]) 
  dm = ma.divide.domain(d1,d2) # array([False,  True, False, False]) 
  result = (d1/d2).view(MaskedArray) # masked_array([-0. inf, 3., 4.]) 
  result._mask = logical_or(m, dm) 
 
</span><span class="s1">Note that a division by zero takes place. To avoid it, we can consider</span>
<span class="s1">to fill the input arrays, taking the domain mask into account, so that:: 
 
  </span><span class="s5">d1 = x._data.copy() # d1 = array([1., 2., 3., 4.]) 
  d2 = y._data.copy() # array([-1.,  0.,  1.,  2.]) 
  dm = ma.divide.domain(d1,d2) # array([False,  True, False, False]) 
  numpy.putmask(d2, dm, 1) # d2 = array([-1.,  1.,  1.,  2.]) 
  m = ma.mask_or(ma.getmask(x), ma.getmask(y)) # m = 
  array([True,False,False,True]) 
  result = (d1/d2).view(MaskedArray) # masked_array([-1. 0., 3., 2.]) 
  result._mask = logical_or(m, dm) 
 
</span><span class="s1">Note that the </span><span class="s4">*.copy()* </span><span class="s1">is required to avoid updating the inputs with</span>
<span class="s4">*putmask*</span><span class="s1">.  The </span><span class="s4">*.filled()* </span><span class="s1">method also involves a </span><span class="s4">*.copy()*</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">A third possibility consists in avoid filling the arrays:: 
 
  </span><span class="s5">d1 = x._data # d1 = array([1., 2., 3., 4.]) 
  d2 = y._data # array([-1.,  0.,  1.,  2.]) 
  dm = ma.divide.domain(d1,d2) # array([False,  True, False, False]) 
  m = ma.mask_or(ma.getmask(x), ma.getmask(y)) # m = 
  array([True,False,False,True]) 
  result = (d1/d2).view(MaskedArray) # masked_array([-1. inf, 3., 2.]) 
  result._mask = logical_or(m, dm) 
 
</span><span class="s1">Note that here again the division by zero takes place.</span>

<span class="s1">A quick benchmark gives the following results:</span>

 <span class="s1">* </span><span class="s4">*numpy.ma.divide*  </span><span class="s1">: 2.69 ms per loop</span>
 <span class="s1">* classical division     : 2.21 ms per loop</span>
 <span class="s1">* division w/ prefilling : 2.34 ms per loop</span>
 <span class="s1">* division w/o filling   : 1.55 ms per loop</span>

<span class="s1">So, is it worth filling the arrays beforehand ? Yes, if we are interested</span>
<span class="s1">in avoiding floating-point exceptions that may fill the result with infs</span>
<span class="s1">and nans. No, if we are only interested into speed...</span>


<span class="s0">Thanks 
------ 
</span>
<span class="s1">I'd like to thank Paul Dubois, Travis Oliphant and Sasha for the</span>
<span class="s1">original masked array package: without you, I would never have started</span>
<span class="s1">that (it might be argued that I shouldn't have anyway, but that's</span>
<span class="s1">another story...).  I also wish to extend these thanks to Reggie Dugard</span>
<span class="s1">and Eric Firing for their suggestions and numerous improvements.</span>
