<pre><span class="s0">Rules for Migrating TypeEngine classes to 0.6</span>
<span class="s0">---------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">1. the TypeEngine classes are used for:</span>

    <span class="s0">a. Specifying behavior which needs to occur for bind parameters</span>
    <span class="s0">or result row columns.</span>

    <span class="s0">b. Specifying types that are entirely specific to the database</span>
    <span class="s0">in use and have no analogue in the sqlalchemy.types package.</span>

    <span class="s0">c. Specifying types where there is an analogue in sqlalchemy.types,</span>
    <span class="s0">but the database in use takes vendor-specific flags for those</span>
    <span class="s0">types.</span>

    <span class="s0">d. If a TypeEngine class doesn't provide any of this, it should be</span>
    <span class="s0">*removed* from the dialect.</span>

<span class="s0">2. the TypeEngine classes are *no longer* used for generating DDL.  Dialects</span>
<span class="s0">now have a TypeCompiler subclass which uses the same visit_XXX model as</span>
<span class="s0">other compilers.</span>

<span class="s0">3. the &quot;ischema_names&quot; and &quot;colspecs&quot; dictionaries are now required members on</span>
<span class="s0">the Dialect class.</span>

<span class="s0">4. The names of types within dialects are now important.   If a dialect-specific type</span>
<span class="s0">is a subclass of an existing generic type and is only provided for bind/result behavior, </span>
<span class="s0">the current mixed case naming can remain, i.e. _PGNumeric for Numeric - in this case, </span>
<span class="s0">end users would never need to use _PGNumeric directly.   However, if a dialect-specific </span>
<span class="s0">type is specifying a type *or* arguments that are not present generically, it should</span>
<span class="s0">match the real name of the type on that backend, in uppercase.  E.g. postgresql.INET,</span>
<span class="s0">mysql.ENUM, postgresql.ARRAY.</span>

<span class="s0">Or follow this handy flowchart:</span>

    <span class="s0">is the type meant to provide bind/result                  is the type the same name as an</span>
    <span class="s0">behavior to a generic type (i.e. MixedCase)  ---- no ---&gt; UPPERCASE type in types.py ?</span>
    <span class="s0">type in types.py ?                                          |                     |</span>
                    <span class="s0">|                                           no                    yes</span>
                   <span class="s0">yes                                          |                     |</span>
                    <span class="s0">|                                           |             does your type need special</span>

                                                        <span class="s0">UPPERCASE</span>
                                                        <span class="s0">type in types.py</span>
                                                        <span class="s0">(i.e. class BLOB(types.BLOB))</span>


<span class="s0">Example 1.   pysqlite needs bind/result processing for the DateTime type in types.py, </span>
<span class="s0">which applies to all DateTimes and subclasses.   It's named _SLDateTime and </span>
<span class="s0">subclasses types.DateTime.</span>

<span class="s0">Example 2.  MS-SQL has a TIME type which takes a non-standard &quot;precision&quot; argument</span>
<span class="s0">that is rendered within DDL.   So it's named TIME in the MS-SQL dialect's base.py, </span>
<span class="s0">and subclasses types.TIME.  Users can then say mssql.TIME(precision=10).</span>

<span class="s0">Example 3.  MS-SQL dialects also need special bind/result processing for date </span>
<span class="s0">But its DATE type doesn't render DDL differently than that of a plain </span>
<span class="s0">DATE, i.e. it takes no special arguments.  Therefore we are just adding behavior</span>
<span class="s0">to types.Date, so it's named _MSDate in the MS-SQL dialect's base.py, and subclasses</span>
<span class="s0">types.Date.</span>

<span class="s0">Example 4.  MySQL has a SET type, there's no analogue for this in types.py. So</span>
<span class="s0">MySQL names it SET in the dialect's base.py, and it subclasses types.String, since </span>
<span class="s0">it ultimately deals with strings.</span>

<span class="s0">Example 5.  PostgreSQL has a DATETIME type.  The DBAPIs handle dates correctly,</span>
<span class="s0">and no special arguments are used in PG's DDL beyond what types.py provides.</span>
<span class="s0">PostgreSQL dialect therefore imports types.DATETIME into its base.py.</span>

<span class="s0">Ideally one should be able to specify a schema using names imported completely from a </span>
<span class="s0">dialect, all matching the real name on that backend:</span>

   <span class="s0">from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import base as pg</span>

   <span class="s0">t = Table('mytable', metadata,</span>
              <span class="s0">Column('id', pg.INTEGER, primary_key=True),</span>
              <span class="s0">Column('name', pg.VARCHAR(300)),</span>
              <span class="s0">Column('inetaddr', pg.INET)</span>
   <span class="s0">)</span>

<span class="s0">where above, the INTEGER and VARCHAR types are ultimately from sqlalchemy.types, </span>
<span class="s0">but the PG dialect makes them available in its own namespace.</span>

<span class="s0">5. &quot;colspecs&quot; now is a dictionary of generic or uppercased types from sqlalchemy.types</span>
<span class="s0">linked to types specified in the dialect.   Again, if a type in the dialect does not</span>
<span class="s0">specify any special behavior for bind_processor() or result_processor() and does not</span>
<span class="s0">indicate a special type only available in this database, it must be *removed* from the </span>
<span class="s0">module and from this dictionary.</span>

<span class="s0">6. &quot;ischema_names&quot; indicates string descriptions of types as returned from the database</span>
<span class="s0">linked to TypeEngine classes.</span>

    <span class="s0">a. The string name should be matched to the most specific type possible within</span>
    <span class="s0">sqlalchemy.types, unless there is no matching type within sqlalchemy.types in which</span>
    <span class="s0">case it points to a dialect type.   *It doesn't matter* if the dialect has its </span>
    <span class="s0">own subclass of that type with special bind/result behavior - reflect to the types.py</span>
    <span class="s0">UPPERCASE type as much as possible.   With very few exceptions, all types</span>
    <span class="s0">should reflect to an UPPERCASE type.</span>

    <span class="s0">b. If the dialect contains a matching dialect-specific type that takes extra arguments </span>
    <span class="s0">which the generic one does not, then point to the dialect-specific type.  E.g.</span>
    <span class="s0">mssql.VARCHAR takes a &quot;collation&quot; parameter which should be preserved.</span>

<span class="s0">5. DDL, or what was formerly issued by &quot;get_col_spec()&quot;, is now handled exclusively by</span>
<span class="s0">a subclass of compiler.GenericTypeCompiler.</span>

    <span class="s0">a. your TypeCompiler class will receive generic and uppercase types from </span>
    <span class="s0">sqlalchemy.types.  Do not assume the presence of dialect-specific attributes on</span>
    <span class="s0">these types. </span>

    <span class="s0">b. the visit_UPPERCASE methods on GenericTypeCompiler should *not* be overridden with</span>
    <span class="s0">methods that produce a different DDL name.   Uppercase types don't do any kind of </span>
    <span class="s0">&quot;guessing&quot; - if visit_TIMESTAMP is called, the DDL should render as TIMESTAMP in</span>
    <span class="s0">all cases, regardless of whether or not that type is legal on the backend database.</span>

    <span class="s0">c. the visit_UPPERCASE methods *should* be overridden with methods that add additional</span>
    <span class="s0">arguments and flags to those types.</span>

    <span class="s0">d. the visit_lowercase methods are overridden to provide an interpretation of a generic </span>
    <span class="s0">type.  E.g.  visit_large_binary() might be overridden to say &quot;return self.visit_BIT(type_)&quot;.</span>

    <span class="s0">e. visit_lowercase methods should *never* render strings directly - it should always</span>
    <span class="s0">be via calling a visit_UPPERCASE() method.</span>
