<pre><span class="s0"># Commonly used types</span>
<span class="s0"># These are redefinitions of the ones defined by numpy in</span>
<span class="s0"># https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy/__init__.pxd.</span>
<span class="s0"># It will eventually avoid having to always include the numpy headers even when we</span>
<span class="s0"># would only use it for the types.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># When used to declare variables that will receive values from numpy arrays, it</span>
<span class="s0"># should match the dtype of the array. For example, to declare a variable that will</span>
<span class="s0"># receive values from a numpy array of dtype np.float64, the type float64_t must be</span>
<span class="s0"># used.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># TODO: Stop defining custom types locally or globally like DTYPE_t and friends and</span>
<span class="s0"># use these consistently throughout the codebase.</span>
<span class="s0"># NOTE: Extend this list as needed when converting more cython extensions.</span>

<span class="s2">ctypedef </span><span class="s1">unsigned long long uint64_t</span>
<span class="s0"># Note: In NumPy 2, indexing always happens with npy_intp which is an alias for</span>
<span class="s0"># the Py_ssize_t type, see PEP 353.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Note that on most platforms Py_ssize_t is equivalent to C99's intptr_t,</span>
<span class="s0"># but they can differ on architecture with segmented memory (none</span>
<span class="s0"># supported by scikit-learn at the time of writing).</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># intp_t/np.intp should be used to index arrays in a platform dependent way.</span>
<span class="s0"># Storing arrays with platform dependent dtypes as attribute on picklable</span>
<span class="s0"># objects is not recommended as it requires special care when loading and</span>
<span class="s0"># using such datastructures on a host with different bitness. Instead one</span>
<span class="s0"># should rather use fixed width integer types such as int32 or uint32 when we know</span>
<span class="s0"># that the number of elements to index is not larger to 2 or 4 billions.</span>

<span class="s0"># Sparse matrices indices and indices' pointers arrays must use int32_t over</span>
<span class="s0"># intp_t because intp_t is platform dependent.</span>
<span class="s0"># When large sparse matrices are supported, indexing must use int64_t.</span>
<span class="s0"># See https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23653 which tracks the</span>
<span class="s0"># ongoing work to support large sparse matrices.</span>
