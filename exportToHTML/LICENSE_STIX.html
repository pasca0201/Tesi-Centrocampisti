<span class="s0">PREAMBLE</span>
<span class="s0">The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide</span>
<span class="s0">development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation</span>
<span class="s0">efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and</span>
<span class="s0">open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership</span>
<span class="s0">with others.</span>

<span class="s0">The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and</span>
<span class="s0">redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The</span>
<span class="s0">fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,</span>
<span class="s0">redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved</span>
<span class="s0">names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,</span>
<span class="s0">however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The</span>
<span class="s0">requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply</span>
<span class="s0">to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</span>

<span class="s0">DEFINITIONS</span>
