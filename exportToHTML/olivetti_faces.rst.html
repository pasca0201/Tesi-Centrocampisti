<span class="s2">The Olivetti faces dataset 
-------------------------- 
</span>
<span class="s1">`This dataset contains a set of face images`_ </span><span class="s0">taken between April 1992 and</span>
<span class="s0">April 1994 at AT&amp;T Laboratories Cambridge. The</span>
<span class="s3">:func:</span><span class="s4">`sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces` </span><span class="s0">function is the data</span>
<span class="s0">fetching / caching function that downloads the data</span>
<span class="s0">archive from AT&amp;T.</span>

<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">_This dataset contains a set of face images: https://cam-orl.co.uk/facedatabase.html</span>

<span class="s0">As described on the original website:</span>

    <span class="s0">There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some</span>
    <span class="s0">subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting,</span>
    <span class="s0">facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial</span>
    <span class="s0">details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark</span>
    <span class="s0">homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position</span>
    <span class="s0">(with tolerance for some side movement).</span>

<span class="s5">**Data Set Characteristics:**</span>

<span class="s0">=================   =====================</span>
<span class="s0">Classes                                40</span>
<span class="s0">Samples total                         400</span>
<span class="s0">Dimensionality                       4096</span>
<span class="s0">Features            real, between 0 and 1</span>
<span class="s0">=================   =====================</span>

<span class="s0">The image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned 8-bit</span>
<span class="s0">integers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the</span>
<span class="s0">interval [0, 1], which are easier to work with for many algorithms.</span>

<span class="s0">The &quot;target&quot; for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating the</span>
<span class="s0">identity of the person pictured; however, with only 10 examples per class, this</span>
<span class="s0">relatively small dataset is more interesting from an unsupervised or</span>
<span class="s0">semi-supervised perspective.</span>

<span class="s0">The original dataset consisted of 92 x 112, while the version available here</span>
<span class="s0">consists of 64x64 images.</span>

<span class="s0">When using these images, please give credit to AT&amp;T Laboratories Cambridge.</span>
