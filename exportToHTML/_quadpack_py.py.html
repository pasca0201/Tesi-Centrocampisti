    Compute a definite integral. 
 
    Integrate func from `a` to `b` (possibly infinite interval) using a 
    technique from the Fortran library QUADPACK. 
 
    Parameters 
    ---------- 
    func : {function, scipy.LowLevelCallable} 
        A Python function or method to integrate. If `func` takes many 
        arguments, it is integrated along the axis corresponding to the 
        first argument. 
 
        If the user desires improved integration performance, then `f` may 
        be a `scipy.LowLevelCallable` with one of the signatures:: 
 
            double func(double x) 
            double func(double x, void *user_data) 
            double func(int n, double *xx) 
            double func(int n, double *xx, void *user_data) 
 
        The ``user_data`` is the data contained in the `scipy.LowLevelCallable`. 
        In the call forms with ``xx``,  ``n`` is the length of the ``xx`` 
        array which contains ``xx[0] == x`` and the rest of the items are 
        numbers contained in the ``args`` argument of quad. 
 
        In addition, certain ctypes call signatures are supported for 
        backward compatibility, but those should not be used in new code. 
    a : float 
        Lower limit of integration (use -numpy.inf for -infinity). 
    b : float 
        Upper limit of integration (use numpy.inf for +infinity). 
    args : tuple, optional 
        Extra arguments to pass to `func`. 
    full_output : int, optional 
        Non-zero to return a dictionary of integration information. 
        If non-zero, warning messages are also suppressed and the 
        message is appended to the output tuple. 
    complex_func : bool, optional 
        Indicate if the function's (`func`) return type is real 
        (``complex_func=False``: default) or complex (``complex_func=True``). 
        In both cases, the function's argument is real. 
        If full_output is also non-zero, the `infodict`, `message`, and 
        `explain` for the real and complex components are returned in 
        a dictionary with keys &quot;real output&quot; and &quot;imag output&quot;. 
 
    Returns 
    ------- 
    y : float 
        The integral of func from `a` to `b`. 
    abserr : float 
        An estimate of the absolute error in the result. 
    infodict : dict 
        A dictionary containing additional information. 
    message 
        A convergence message. 
    explain 
        Appended only with 'cos' or 'sin' weighting and infinite 
        integration limits, it contains an explanation of the codes in 
        infodict['ierlst'] 
 
    Other Parameters 
    ---------------- 
    epsabs : float or int, optional 
        Absolute error tolerance. Default is 1.49e-8. `quad` tries to obtain 
        an accuracy of ``abs(i-result) &lt;= max(epsabs, epsrel*abs(i))`` 
        where ``i`` = integral of `func` from `a` to `b`, and ``result`` is the 
        numerical approximation. See `epsrel` below. 
    epsrel : float or int, optional 
        Relative error tolerance. Default is 1.49e-8. 
        If ``epsabs &lt;= 0``, `epsrel` must be greater than both 5e-29 
        and ``50 * (machine epsilon)``. See `epsabs` above. 
    limit : float or int, optional 
        An upper bound on the number of subintervals used in the adaptive 
        algorithm. 
    points : (sequence of floats,ints), optional 
        A sequence of break points in the bounded integration interval 
        where local difficulties of the integrand may occur (e.g., 
        singularities, discontinuities). The sequence does not have 
        to be sorted. Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction 
        with ``weight``. 
    weight : float or int, optional 
        String indicating weighting function. Full explanation for this 
        and the remaining arguments can be found below. 
    wvar : optional 
        Variables for use with weighting functions. 
    wopts : optional 
        Optional input for reusing Chebyshev moments. 
    maxp1 : float or int, optional 
        An upper bound on the number of Chebyshev moments. 
    limlst : int, optional 
        Upper bound on the number of cycles (&gt;=3) for use with a sinusoidal 
        weighting and an infinite end-point.

    Notes 
    ----- 
    For valid results, the integral must converge; behavior for divergent 
    integrals is not guaranteed. 
 
    **Extra information for quad() inputs and outputs** 
 
    If full_output is non-zero, then the third output argument 
    (infodict) is a dictionary with entries as tabulated below. For 
    infinite limits, the range is transformed to (0,1) and the 
    optional outputs are given with respect to this transformed range. 
    Let M be the input argument limit and let K be infodict['last']. 
    The entries are: 
 
    'neval' 
        The number of function evaluations. 
    'last' 
        The number, K, of subintervals produced in the subdivision process. 
    'alist' 
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the 
        left end points of the subintervals in the partition of the 
        integration range. 
    'blist' 
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the 
        right end points of the subintervals. 
    'rlist' 
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the 
        integral approximations on the subintervals. 
    'elist' 
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the 
        moduli of the absolute error estimates on the subintervals. 
    'iord' 
        A rank-1 integer array of length M, the first L elements of 
        which are pointers to the error estimates over the subintervals 
        with ``L=K`` if ``K&lt;=M/2+2`` or ``L=M+1-K`` otherwise. Let I be the 
        sequence ``infodict['iord']`` and let E be the sequence 
        ``infodict['elist']``.  Then ``E[I[1]], ..., E[I[L]]`` forms a 
        decreasing sequence. 
 
    If the input argument points is provided (i.e., it is not None), 
    the following additional outputs are placed in the output 
    dictionary. Assume the points sequence is of length P. 
 
    'pts' 
        A rank-1 array of length P+2 containing the integration limits 
        and the break points of the intervals in ascending order. 
        This is an array giving the subintervals over which integration 
        will occur. 
    'level' 
        A rank-1 integer array of length M (=limit), containing the 
        subdivision levels of the subintervals, i.e., if (aa,bb) is a 
        subinterval of ``(pts[1], pts[2])`` where ``pts[0]`` and ``pts[2]`` 
        are adjacent elements of ``infodict['pts']``, then (aa,bb) has level l 
        if ``|bb-aa| = |pts[2]-pts[1]| * 2**(-l)``. 
    'ndin' 
        A rank-1 integer array of length P+2. After the first integration 
        over the intervals (pts[1], pts[2]), the error estimates over some 
        of the intervals may have been increased artificially in order to 
        put their subdivision forward. This array has ones in slots 
        corresponding to the subintervals for which this happens. 
 
    **Weighting the integrand** 
 
    The input variables, *weight* and *wvar*, are used to weight the 
    integrand by a select list of functions. Different integration 
    methods are used to compute the integral with these weighting 
    functions, and these do not support specifying break points. The 
    possible values of weight and the corresponding weighting functions are. 
 
    ==========  ===================================   ===================== 
    ``weight``  Weight function used                  ``wvar`` 
    ==========  ===================================   ===================== 
    'cos'       cos(w*x)                              wvar = w 
    'sin'       sin(w*x)                              wvar = w 
    'alg'       g(x) = ((x-a)**alpha)*((b-x)**beta)   wvar = (alpha, beta) 
    'alg-loga'  g(x)*log(x-a)                         wvar = (alpha, beta) 
    'alg-logb'  g(x)*log(b-x)                         wvar = (alpha, beta) 
    'alg-log'   g(x)*log(x-a)*log(b-x)                wvar = (alpha, beta) 
    'cauchy'    1/(x-c)                               wvar = c 
    ==========  ===================================   ===================== 
 
    wvar holds the parameter w, (alpha, beta), or c depending on the weight 
    selected. In these expressions, a and b are the integration limits. 
 
    For the 'cos' and 'sin' weighting, additional inputs and outputs are 
    available. 
 
    For finite integration limits, the integration is performed using a 
    Clenshaw-Curtis method which uses Chebyshev moments. For repeated 
    calculations, these moments are saved in the output dictionary: 
 
    'momcom' 
        The maximum level of Chebyshev moments that have been computed, 
        i.e., if ``M_c`` is ``infodict['momcom']`` then the moments have been 
        computed for intervals of length ``|b-a| * 2**(-l)``, 
        ``l=0,1,...,M_c``. 
    'nnlog' 
        A rank-1 integer array of length M(=limit), containing the 
        subdivision levels of the subintervals, i.e., an element of this 
        array is equal to l if the corresponding subinterval is 
        ``|b-a|* 2**(-l)``. 
    'chebmo' 
        A rank-2 array of shape (25, maxp1) containing the computed 
        Chebyshev moments. These can be passed on to an integration 
        over the same interval by passing this array as the second 
        element of the sequence wopts and passing infodict['momcom'] as 
        the first element. 
 
    If one of the integration limits is infinite, then a Fourier integral is 
    computed (assuming w neq 0). If full_output is 1 and a numerical error 
    is encountered, besides the error message attached to the output tuple, 
    a dictionary is also appended to the output tuple which translates the 
    error codes in the array ``info['ierlst']`` to English messages. The 
    output information dictionary contains the following entries instead of 
    'last', 'alist', 'blist', 'rlist', and 'elist': 
 
    'lst' 
        The number of subintervals needed for the integration (call it ``K_f``). 
    'rslst' 
        A rank-1 array of length M_f=limlst, whose first ``K_f`` elements 
        contain the integral contribution over the interval 
        ``(a+(k-1)c, a+kc)`` where ``c = (2*floor(|w|) + 1) * pi / |w|`` 
        and ``k=1,2,...,K_f``. 
    'erlst' 
        A rank-1 array of length ``M_f`` containing the error estimate 
        corresponding to the interval in the same position in 
        ``infodict['rslist']``. 
    'ierlst' 
        A rank-1 integer array of length ``M_f`` containing an error flag 
        corresponding to the interval in the same position in 
        ``infodict['rslist']``.  See the explanation dictionary (last entry 
        in the output tuple) for the meaning of the codes. 
 
 
    **Details of QUADPACK level routines** 
 
    `quad` calls routines from the FORTRAN library QUADPACK. This section 
    provides details on the conditions for each routine to be called and a 
    short description of each routine. The routine called depends on 
    `weight`, `points` and the integration limits `a` and `b`.

    ================  ==============  ==========  ===================== 
 
    The following provides a short description from [1]_ for each 
    routine. 
 
    qagse 
        is an integrator based on globally adaptive interval 
        subdivision in connection with extrapolation, which will 
        eliminate the effects of integrand singularities of 
        several types. 
    qagie 
        handles integration over infinite intervals. The infinite range is 
        mapped onto a finite interval and subsequently the same strategy as 
        in ``QAGS`` is applied. 
    qagpe 
        serves the same purposes as QAGS, but also allows the 
        user to provide explicit information about the location 
        and type of trouble-spots i.e. the abscissae of internal 
        singularities, discontinuities and other difficulties of 
        the integrand function. 
    qawoe 
        is an integrator for the evaluation of 
        :math:`\\int^b_a \\cos(\\omega x)f(x)dx` or 
        :math:`\\int^b_a \\sin(\\omega x)f(x)dx` 
        over a finite interval [a,b], where :math:`\\omega` and :math:`f` 
        are specified by the user. The rule evaluation component is based 
        on the modified Clenshaw-Curtis technique 
 
        An adaptive subdivision scheme is used in connection 
        with an extrapolation procedure, which is a modification 
        of that in ``QAGS`` and allows the algorithm to deal with 
        singularities in :math:`f(x)`. 
    qawfe 
        calculates the Fourier transform 
        :math:`\\int^\\infty_a \\cos(\\omega x)f(x)dx` or 
        :math:`\\int^\\infty_a \\sin(\\omega x)f(x)dx` 
        for user-provided :math:`\\omega` and :math:`f`. The procedure of 
        ``QAWO`` is applied on successive finite intervals, and convergence 
        acceleration by means of the :math:`\\varepsilon`-algorithm is applied 
        to the series of integral approximations. 
    qawse 
        approximate :math:`\\int^b_a w(x)f(x)dx`, with :math:`a &lt; b` where 
        :math:`w(x) = (x-a)^{\\alpha}(b-x)^{\\beta}v(x)` with 
        :math:`\\alpha,\\beta &gt; -1`, where :math:`v(x)` may be one of the 
        following functions: :math:`1`, :math:`\\log(x-a)`, :math:`\\log(b-x)`, 
        :math:`\\log(x-a)\\log(b-x)`. 
 
        The user specifies :math:`\\alpha`, :math:`\\beta` and the type of the 
        function :math:`v`. A globally adaptive subdivision strategy is 
        applied, with modified Clenshaw-Curtis integration on those 
        subintervals which contain `a` or `b`. 
    qawce 
        compute :math:`\\int^b_a f(x) / (x-c)dx` where the integral must be 
        interpreted as a Cauchy principal value integral, for user specified 
        :math:`c` and :math:`f`. The strategy is globally adaptive. Modified 
        Clenshaw-Curtis integration is used on those intervals containing the 
        point :math:`x = c`. 
 
    **Integration of Complex Function of a Real Variable** 
 
    A complex valued function, :math:`f`, of a real variable can be written as 
    :math:`f = g + ih`.  Similarly, the integral of :math:`f` can be 
    written as 
 
    .. math:: 
        \\int_a^b f(x) dx = \\int_a^b g(x) dx + i\\int_a^b h(x) dx 
 
    assuming that the integrals of :math:`g` and :math:`h` exist 
    over the interval :math:`[a,b]` [2]_. Therefore, ``quad`` integrates 
    complex-valued functions by integrating the real and imaginary components 
    separately.

    Be aware that pulse shapes and other sharp features as compared to the 
    size of the integration interval may not be integrated correctly using

    Compute a double integral. 
 
    Return the double (definite) integral of ``func(y, x)`` from ``x = a..b`` 
    and ``y = gfun(x)..hfun(x)``. 
 
    Parameters 
    ---------- 
    func : callable 
        A Python function or method of at least two variables: y must be the 
        first argument and x the second argument. 
    a, b : float 
        The limits of integration in x: `a` &lt; `b` 
    gfun : callable or float 
        The lower boundary curve in y which is a function taking a single 
        floating point argument (x) and returning a floating point result 
        or a float indicating a constant boundary curve. 
    hfun : callable or float 
        The upper boundary curve in y (same requirements as `gfun`). 
    args : sequence, optional 
        Extra arguments to pass to `func`. 
    epsabs : float, optional 
        Absolute tolerance passed directly to the inner 1-D quadrature 
        integration. Default is 1.49e-8. ``dblquad`` tries to obtain 
        an accuracy of ``abs(i-result) &lt;= max(epsabs, epsrel*abs(i))`` 
        where ``i`` = inner integral of ``func(y, x)`` from ``gfun(x)`` 
        to ``hfun(x)``, and ``result`` is the numerical approximation. 
        See `epsrel` below. 
    epsrel : float, optional 
        Relative tolerance of the inner 1-D integrals. Default is 1.49e-8. 
        If ``epsabs &lt;= 0``, `epsrel` must be greater than both 5e-29 
        and ``50 * (machine epsilon)``. See `epsabs` above. 
 
    Returns 
    ------- 
    y : float 
        The resultant integral. 
    abserr : float 
        An estimate of the error. 
 
    See Also 
    -------- 
    quad : single integral 
    tplquad : triple integral 
    nquad : N-dimensional integrals 
    fixed_quad : fixed-order Gaussian quadrature 
    simpson : integrator for sampled data 
    romb : integrator for sampled data 
    scipy.special : for coefficients and roots of orthogonal polynomials 
 
 
    Notes 
    ----- 
    For valid results, the integral must converge; behavior for divergent 
    integrals is not guaranteed. 
 
    **Details of QUADPACK level routines** 
 
    `quad` calls routines from the FORTRAN library QUADPACK. This section 
    provides details on the conditions for each routine to be called and a 
    short description of each routine. For each level of integration, ``qagse`` 
    is used for finite limits or ``qagie`` is used if either limit (or both!) 
    are infinite. The following provides a short description from [1]_ for each 
    routine. 
 
    qagse 
        is an integrator based on globally adaptive interval 
        subdivision in connection with extrapolation, which will 
        eliminate the effects of integrand singularities of 
        several types. 
    qagie 
        handles integration over infinite intervals. The infinite range is 
        mapped onto a finite interval and subsequently the same strategy as 
        in ``QAGS`` is applied.

    **Details of QUADPACK level routines** 
 
    `quad` calls routines from the FORTRAN library QUADPACK. This section 
    provides details on the conditions for each routine to be called and a 
    short description of each routine. For each level of integration, ``qagse`` 
    is used for finite limits or ``qagie`` is used, if either limit (or both!) 
    are infinite. The following provides a short description from [1]_ for each 
    routine. 
 
    qagse 
        is an integrator based on globally adaptive interval 
        subdivision in connection with extrapolation, which will 
        eliminate the effects of integrand singularities of 
        several types. 
    qagie 
        handles integration over infinite intervals. The infinite range is 
        mapped onto a finite interval and subsequently the same strategy as 
        in ``QAGS`` is applied.

    Integration over multiple variables. 
 
    Wraps `quad` to enable integration over multiple variables. 
    Various options allow improved integration of discontinuous functions, as 
    well as the use of weighted integration, and generally finer control of the 
    integration process. 
 
    Parameters 
    ---------- 
    func : {callable, scipy.LowLevelCallable} 
        The function to be integrated. Has arguments of ``x0, ... xn``, 
        ``t0, ... tm``, where integration is carried out over ``x0, ... xn``, 
        which must be floats.  Where ``t0, ... tm`` are extra arguments 
        passed in args. 
        Function signature should be ``func(x0, x1, ..., xn, t0, t1, ..., tm)``. 
        Integration is carried out in order.  That is, integration over ``x0`` 
        is the innermost integral, and ``xn`` is the outermost. 
 
        If the user desires improved integration performance, then `f` may 
        be a `scipy.LowLevelCallable` with one of the signatures:: 
 
            double func(int n, double *xx) 
            double func(int n, double *xx, void *user_data) 
 
        where ``n`` is the number of variables and args.  The ``xx`` array 
        contains the coordinates and extra arguments. ``user_data`` is the data 
        contained in the `scipy.LowLevelCallable`. 
    ranges : iterable object 
        Each element of ranges may be either a sequence  of 2 numbers, or else 
        a callable that returns such a sequence. ``ranges[0]`` corresponds to 
        integration over x0, and so on. If an element of ranges is a callable, 
        then it will be called with all of the integration arguments available, 
        as well as any parametric arguments. e.g., if 
        ``func = f(x0, x1, x2, t0, t1)``, then ``ranges[0]`` may be defined as 
        either ``(a, b)`` or else as ``(a, b) = range0(x1, x2, t0, t1)``. 
    args : iterable object, optional 
        Additional arguments ``t0, ... tn``, required by ``func``, ``ranges``, 
        and ``opts``. 
    opts : iterable object or dict, optional 
        Options to be passed to `quad`. May be empty, a dict, or 
        a sequence of dicts or functions that return a dict. If empty, the 
        default options from scipy.integrate.quad are used. If a dict, the same 
        options are used for all levels of integraion. If a sequence, then each 
        element of the sequence corresponds to a particular integration. e.g., 
        ``opts[0]`` corresponds to integration over ``x0``, and so on. If a 
        callable, the signature must be the same as for ``ranges``. The 
        available options together with their default values are: 
 
          - epsabs = 1.49e-08 
          - epsrel = 1.49e-08 
          - limit  = 50 
          - points = None 
          - weight = None 
          - wvar   = None 
          - wopts  = None 
 
        For more information on these options, see `quad`. 
 
    full_output : bool, optional 
        Partial implementation of ``full_output`` from scipy.integrate.quad. 
        The number of integrand function evaluations ``neval`` can be obtained 
        by setting ``full_output=True`` when calling nquad. 
 
    Returns 
    ------- 
    result : float 
        The result of the integration. 
    abserr : float 
        The maximum of the estimates of the absolute error in the various 
        integration results. 
    out_dict : dict, optional 
        A dict containing additional information on the integration. 
 
    See Also 
    -------- 
    quad : 1-D numerical integration 
    dblquad, tplquad : double and triple integrals 
    fixed_quad : fixed-order Gaussian quadrature 
 
    Notes 
    ----- 
    For valid results, the integral must converge; behavior for divergent 
    integrals is not guaranteed. 
 
    **Details of QUADPACK level routines** 
 
    `nquad` calls routines from the FORTRAN library QUADPACK. This section 
    provides details on the conditions for each routine to be called and a 
    short description of each routine. The routine called depends on 
    `weight`, `points` and the integration limits `a` and `b`.

    The following provides a short description from [1]_ for each 
    routine. 
 
    qagse 
        is an integrator based on globally adaptive interval 
        subdivision in connection with extrapolation, which will 
        eliminate the effects of integrand singularities of 
        several types. 
    qagie 
        handles integration over infinite intervals. The infinite range is 
        mapped onto a finite interval and subsequently the same strategy as 
        in ``QAGS`` is applied. 
    qagpe 
        serves the same purposes as QAGS, but also allows the 
        user to provide explicit information about the location 
        and type of trouble-spots i.e. the abscissae of internal 
        singularities, discontinuities and other difficulties of 
        the integrand function. 
    qawoe 
        is an integrator for the evaluation of 
        :math:`\int^b_a \cos(\omega x)f(x)dx` or 
        :math:`\int^b_a \sin(\omega x)f(x)dx` 
        over a finite interval [a,b], where :math:`\omega` and :math:`f` 
        are specified by the user. The rule evaluation component is based 
        on the modified Clenshaw-Curtis technique 
 
        An adaptive subdivision scheme is used in connection 
        with an extrapolation procedure, which is a modification 
        of that in ``QAGS`` and allows the algorithm to deal with 
        singularities in :math:`f(x)`. 
    qawfe 
        calculates the Fourier transform 
        :math:`\int^\infty_a \cos(\omega x)f(x)dx` or 
        :math:`\int^\infty_a \sin(\omega x)f(x)dx` 
        for user-provided :math:`\omega` and :math:`f`. The procedure of 
        ``QAWO`` is applied on successive finite intervals, and convergence 
        acceleration by means of the :math:`\varepsilon`-algorithm is applied 
        to the series of integral approximations. 
    qawse 
        approximate :math:`\int^b_a w(x)f(x)dx`, with :math:`a &lt; b` where 
        :math:`w(x) = (x-a)^{\alpha}(b-x)^{\beta}v(x)` with 
        :math:`\alpha,\beta &gt; -1`, where :math:`v(x)` may be one of the 
        following functions: :math:`1`, :math:`\log(x-a)`, :math:`\log(b-x)`, 
        :math:`\log(x-a)\log(b-x)`. 
 
        The user specifies :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta` and the type of the 
        function :math:`v`. A globally adaptive subdivision strategy is 
        applied, with modified Clenshaw-Curtis integration on those 
        subintervals which contain `a` or `b`. 
    qawce 
        compute :math:`\int^b_a f(x) / (x-c)dx` where the integral must be 
        interpreted as a Cauchy principal value integral, for user specified 
        :math:`c` and :math:`f`. The strategy is globally adaptive. Modified 
        Clenshaw-Curtis integration is used on those intervals containing the 
        point :math:`x = c`.
