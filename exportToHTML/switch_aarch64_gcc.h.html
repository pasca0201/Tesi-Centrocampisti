 reading and writing. 
 
 This is followed by ``r`` (must be register) or ``m`` (must be memory)

 The ``cvariablename`` is actually an lvalue expression. 
 
 In AArch65, 31 general purpose registers. If named X0... they are 
 64-bit. If named W0... they are the bottom 32 bits of the 
 corresponding 64 bit register. 
 
 XZR and WZR are hardcoded to 0, and ignore writes. 
 
 Arguments are in X0..X7. C++ uses X0 for ``this``. X0 holds simple return 
 values (?) 
 
 Whenever a W register is written, the top half of the X register is zeroed.

		<span class="s0">/* SLP_SAVE_STATE macro contains some return statements 
           (of -1 and 1).  It falls through only when 
           the return value of slp_save_state() is zero, which 
           is placed in x0. 
           In that case we (slp_switch) also want to return zero 
           (also in x0 of course). 
           Now, some GCC versions (seen with 4.8) think it's a 
           good idea to save/restore x0 around the call to 
           slp_restore_state(), instead of simply zeroing it 
           at the return below.  But slp_restore_state 
           writes random values to the stack slot used for this 
           save/restore (from when it once was saved above in 
           SLP_SAVE_STATE, when it was still uninitialized), so 
           &quot;restoring&quot; that precious zero actually makes us 
           return random values.  There are some ways to make 
           GCC not use that zero value in the normal return path 
           (e.g. making err volatile, but that costs a little 
           stack space), and the simplest is to call a function 
           that returns an unknown value (which happens to be zero), 
           so the saved/restored value is unused. 
 
                   Thus, this line stores a 0 into the ``err`` variable 
                   (which must be held in a register for this instruction, 
                    of course). The ``w`` qualifier causes the instruction 
                    to use W0 instead of X0, otherwise we get a warning 
                    about a value size mismatch (because err is an int, 
                    and aarch64 platforms are LP64: 32-bit int, 64 bit long 
                   and pointer).
